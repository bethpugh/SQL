/*For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

/*First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.*/
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

/*Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity*/
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

/*Then I looked at which songs had the most acousticness*/
select track_name, artist_name, acousticness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY acousticness desc 
LIMIT 10;

/*Next I looked at average popularity with acousticness*/
select track_name, artist_name, acousticness, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) desc 
LIMIT 10;
